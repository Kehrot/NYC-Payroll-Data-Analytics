I couldn't be more disappointed with this course. The limited time allowed for using the Azure lab makes it almost impossible to complete the projects for people like me, who can only dedicate a few hours a day to the course. Being a supposedly self-paced course, this makes no sense. Additionally, there are blocking points in the Azure infrastructure that are not covered in the course. This wouldn't be a problem if support were provided in the Knowledge help forum, but the reality is that most of the "mentors" aim to give quick answers and get them validated, presumably to get paid based on the number of responses they provide. I was stuck for three days with an issue in the SQL server linked service (see link), and no one gave me a valid solution until I finally stumbled upon one by chance. Now I am stuck again (see link) and don't have much hope of getting a solution. My subscription time is running out, and I need to complete the project. I can only do as much as the lab allows. If I can't continue due to infrastructure blockages for which they do not provide support, I don't know what else to do. I've spent four days recreating the project steps from scratch over and over again, and I'm starting to get really frustrated.
